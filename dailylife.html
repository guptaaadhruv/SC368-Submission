                <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">
                    <h2>Life at an Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) is intense, fast-paced, and filled with both academic rigor and opportunities for personal growth. Here’s a glimpse into the daily routine of an IITian.</h2>
                    <h1>
                        Early Morning: The Struggle to Wake Up</h1>
                    <h2>The day begins early, typically around 6 AM, though late-night study sessions are common. After a quick shower and breakfast, students head to their first lecture, which is often one of the core subjects like algorithms or mechanical engineering. Mornings are filled with challenging theoretical and practical lessons</h2>
                    <h1>Academic Day: Classes, Labs, and Assignments</h1>
                    <h2>IIT classrooms are fast-paced, with professors expecting active participation. Students spend hours in lectures, engaging in discussions, and solving problems. Labs are a significant part of the day, allowing students to apply theoretical knowledge through hands-on experiments. Group work is common, fostering teamwork and collaboration.</h2>
                    <h1>Night: Late-Night Study Sessions</h1>
                    <h2>As night falls, many students dive into more intense studying. The library and hostels are busy late into the night, with peer discussions and study groups being a common sight. These sessions are essential for preparing for exams or finishing projects.</h2>
                    <h1>The Bottom Line: Challenges and Rewards</h1>
                    <h2>An IITian’s day is a blend of hard work and personal development. The pressures are high, but the opportunities for learning and growth are immense. The experience prepares students for success, both academically and professionally, in a world-class environment.</h2>
